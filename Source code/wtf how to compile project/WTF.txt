Tiny XSS Scanner is a 'special' project to compile in Visual Basic 6.0
you need to modify files because we use ufMOD

Go to: C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\VB98
rename LINK.EXE in LNK.EXE


now copy the file LINK.EXE and link.c in the same folder
you can compile now with ufMOD !
dont forget if you make an executable, be sure ufmod.lib is in THE SAME FOLDER
if you try to compile the executable with no ufmod.lib you won error in the linker "LNK : fatal error LNK1181 blah blah blah..."

be safe
